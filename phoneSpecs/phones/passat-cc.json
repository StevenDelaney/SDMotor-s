    "description": "The VW CC has been quite a success, with more than 300,000 sold worldwide since the original VW Passat CC was launched in 2008. Standing for Comfort Coupé, it offers four-door practicality with a bit more glamour than the more staid saloon on which it’s based.There’s good news in the engine department, too. The base 1.4-litre petrol is quick enough and fairly frugal but most will be more interested in the punchy yet economical 2.0-litre diesels. Emissions may not be quite as good as some rivals, but the most popular 148bhp diesel manages a respectable 118g/km of CO2, enough for a benefit-in-kind (BIK) rate of 23%.The CC is expensive when compared to more conventional saloon rivals, but counters this with a generous level of standard equipment. Even the lowliest CC receives sat-nav, a DAB radio, two-zone climate control and automatic bi-xenon headlights.",
