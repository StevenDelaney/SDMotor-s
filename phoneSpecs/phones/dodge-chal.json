    "description": "The Challenger is one big bruiser, with heft better suited to cruising or drag-racing at the strip than turning laps on a race track. Powertrains include the standard 305-hp 3.6-liter V-6 and an eight-speed auto; a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 makes 375 hp when paired with the standard six-speed manual and 372 hp with the optional eight-speed automatic. The Scat Pack option features a 485-hp 6.4-liter Hemi V-8; a six-speed manual is standard and a eight-speed auto is optional. The Challenger is a major salvo in the Horsepower Wars, offering muscle-car metal and seriously awesome engines. The 6.4-liter Hemi V-8 makes 485 hp and 475 lb-ft; choose either a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic. The aptly named Hellcat has a supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 good for 707 hp and 650 lb-ft, with either a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic. The automatic is faster, hitting 60 mph in 3.6 seconds, while the manual is more fun and still quick doing 0–60 in 3.9 seconds.",
