    "description": "The Audi R8 is a supercar from a dying breed. As makers add turbochargers to their cars to meet ever-stricter emissions targets, the naturally aspirated engine is falling out of favour, and in some ways the R8 is a fantastic last hurrah. But while the 5.2-litre V10 is a focal point of the car, there's much more to the R8 than simply a big engine.It's as useable as an Audi TT on a daily basis, if you can live with the running costs, and its ease of use would put some superminis to shame. Quattro four-wheel drive means it has plenty of traction and grip, but unlike many fast Audis, it's enjoyable to drive on track. It's nimble and agile, while the V10 packs a punch that's accompanied by a thrilling V10 soundtrack, especially if you go for the R8 V10 Plus.",
