    "description": "That sharply-cut nose is already a familiar sight on the UK’s roads, despite the latest BMW 3 Series only actually being launched a few years ago. The F30 range is broad, with umpteen engines, trims and even a four-wheel drive version, dubbed 3 Series xDrive (which now outsells the Audi A4 quattro).BMW rolled out a new facelifted 3 last year to help it tackle the surprisingly fierce challenge from the Jaguar XE and Audi A4. Visual changes are minor but there’s an almost entirely new engine range and a lift for the interior. Tastes are so varied and requirements so broad that there’s no such thing as the ‘perfect’ car, but the BMW 3 Series arguably comes close. Over the last four decades or so, the 3 Series has established itself as a practical, desirable, economical and – perhaps most significantly – great-to-drive executive saloon.",
